    Displays a sample image on the Frame display as a progressive sprite, rendered incrementally.
    Because each slice of the image is relatively small, peak memory usage on Frame is smaller than with a single
    large sprite when constituent packets are concatenated.

    The images is a JPEG image, so it is first quantized by TxSprite to 16 colors (that is, 4-bits-per-pixel).
    The image is too large for the display (and memory) so it is resized to fit, preserving aspect ratio.

    This will not be the standard palette from the Frame firmware so the frameside app
    (lua/sprite_frame_app.lua) calls `sprite.set_palette()` before the `frame.display.bitmap()` call.
